![](https://i.ibb.co/jyQd8X9/vm-setup.jpg)

# Description
I'll be following along with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNKzKtNTjls&list=PLZ14qQz3cfJJOcbbVi_nVEPqC2334LLMz) and deviating from it as my interests demand.

I'm working on the project in a recently deployed Linux virtual machine to increase my skills in developing in such an environment.

So, not only am I learning more about JAMstack, but I'm also learning ninja terminal skills ü§†
